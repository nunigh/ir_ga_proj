/**
 * The <code>fminsearchOptimizerRemote</code> class provides a Java RMI-compliant 
 * interface to MATLAB functions. The interface is compiled from the following files:
 * <pre>
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\calcNCCbyImgPath.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\fminsearch_HausdorffDist.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\fminsearch_MI.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\fminsearch_NCC.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\fminsearch_surfThingFunc.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\my_NCC.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\myHD.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\NCC_abs.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\printTransformation.m
 *  C:\Users\root\Documents\MATLAB\IR_opt\surfThingTest.m
 * </pre>
 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a 
 * <code>fminsearchOptimizerRemote</code> instance when it is no longer needed to ensure 
 * that native resources allocated by this class are properly freed, and the server-side 
 * proxy is unexported.  (Failure to call dispose may result in server-side threads not 
 * being properly shut down, which often appears as a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of 
 * fminsearch4irDbg.fminsearchOptimizer.
